## GSX Profile Manager by grtn

- First working 0.0.1-alpha version
- Can open a folder and scann for GSX-Profile Folders in there
    - I structure/sync my profiles with MSFS Addon Linker
        - In there I have the Folder Structure
        - Scenery -> Airports -> grtn-eddf-example
        - In this Folder i place a Folder GSX Profile
        - In their place you GSX Files (or multiple ones (GSX vs Aerosoft), just need to be named differently)
- Now you can select your profiles and create a symlink to your GSX Profile Folder
